# Quizzling

A dynamic, AI-inspired quiz game built with modern web technologies, performance optimization and backend integration. This project features a responsive UI, smooth animations, a countdown timer, and a progress bar, with a scalable backend.

- **Responsive UI**: Built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Typescript** for type-safe, performant interfaces.
- **Stylish Design**: Uses **Tailwind CSS 4** with animations (`fade`, `slide-in`, `scale-in`) for an immersive experience.
- **Progress Bar**: Visualizes quiz progress with a gradient-filled bar.
- **Backend Integration**: **Node.js** + **Express** with **PostgreSQL** to store and serve questions dynamically.
- **Performance Optimized**: Leverages `React.memo` to minimize re-renders, focus on high-performance UIs.
- **Accessibility**: Includes ARIA labels for better screen reader support.
- **Reset Functionality**: "Play Again" button to restart the quiz.
